## StoryWiki Example Wiki Index

Welcome to the StoryWiki example wiki index, specifically for the "Books"
continuity! This is designed to be an example site showing off the features of
StoryWiki, rather than containing any actual useful information.

It is expected that you will replace this content, and the rest of the content
on this website, with the content that you wish to actually display. This should
simply serve as a reference and example of how to do several different things.

On the right, you can see the currently loaded pages&mdash;try changing your
release in the top right, or your continuity, and see how everything changes!
